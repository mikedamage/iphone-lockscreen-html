h2. About

I'm starting this repo so I have somewhere to put the scripts I write for my unlocked iPhone.
Most of them are meant to be run as Launchd jobs that render HTML files, which are then displayed in
"Winterboard":http://www.saurik.com/id/9 themes.

h3. Dependencies

To run these on your iPhone, you first need an iPhone. With this dependency satisfied, you then need to jailbreak your iPhone. There's a wealth of information available on this topic and it's very easy to do. Then you need to use Cydia to install Ruby and Winterboard. Then you're all set!
